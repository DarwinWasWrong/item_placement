test code>

this is the sim and the code for you to test.

it should, if the steppers are not at home or limit, 
move  the table bar to home.
move the table bar to limit (eg at the front)
move  the shelf to home.
move the shelf to limit (eg UP position)

then

the "startup" - which will check the switches and move both shelf and table bar  to home

if the home button is not responding, you may have to fiddle with the debounce figure|
on line  77/78

// operator  buttons debounce
long debounceTime = 10;
.
you may need to increase or decrease the value - in steps of ten
It has saftey checks - if you do startup and both limit and home on any system are both on - thats impossible.
also -we need to check the speed and the stopping.

the steppers have acceleration and deceleration settings.
if it doesnt stop in time after a limit or home switch is hit - then we have to adjust
