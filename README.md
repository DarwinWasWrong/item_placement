OP
 â€” 02/11/2022
I'm building a automated parts feeder. 
I have the entire physical unit itself build at this point (Drivers, Step motors, Feeder itself.) All I need in the code itself!
I'm really hoping someone here will be able to help me through this.
I've tried to use a couple different people from fiver with no luck and I'm out a couple hundred bucks. 

I'm going to post two different videos and the code that was written by the fiver guys. (That doesn't work)

Video 1 - Explains how the unit will work.
Video 2 - Is the actual unit that we built.

If someone here can help or knows someone that can help it would be huge for me. Id be willing to compensate someone for their time once the feeder is working.

^^ this is a link to the 2 videos...
The explanation is pretty important.

on start, we have to check for what condition the machine is in.

1. proximity switch must be HIGH - no items
2. SHELF LIMIT should be OFF
3. SHELF HOME  ON
3. TABLE BAR LIMIT should be off
4. TABLE BAR HOME should be ON
5. EMERGENCY SWITCH OFF 




Home Button - Sends vert motors down and Horizonal motors back until they hit switches to stop them.
Start button - Sends Horizonal motors forward periodically pausing when the prox switch is triggered
              finally completely finishing its cycle once a switch is triggered at the end of the cycle.
